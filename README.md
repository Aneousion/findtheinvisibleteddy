# Origin Story

🤣 I saw https://findtheinvisiblecow.com/ on TikTok and I had a good laugh, then I decided I wanted to implement it using React. 

⏱ It took me a couple of hours, maybe less.

🎉 I had a lot of fun adding sound effects and tiny animations.

🐮 It's not as evolved as the Cow game, because it's just Ruby the dog, and the sounds are not that funny, but at least it was a nice and quick and entertaining coding challenge.

📲 Plus, the original Cow game doesn't work on iOS Safari and this React version does work fine there! 😊
